# **Excel-Task-Week-1**
## **Introduction**

This task is based on the data training program am doing on excel.
After the first week lessons I was given task to solve. 
The lesson covered several areas required in data preparation; like the use of conditional formatting, filtering, removal of duplicate if any, splitting of columns, concatenating, sorting, creating of headers, flash filling, etc.
### **Task**
We were told to create an imaginary table showing the fields below:
-	Employee ID
-	Employee Full name
-	Department (Communication, Sales and I.T)
-	Salary (between $5,000 to $25,000)
-	Job Type (Part Time, Freelance or Contract)
Furthermore, we were required to Copy and paste this table to worksheet 2 and 3.
In work sheet 1 we are to show only employees who are ‘Freelancers’ and Highlight the workers with salaries above $10,000.

In worksheet 2, we were required to split the names of the employees to form two columns with first name and last name respectfully, After the split, we can check for duplicates if any exist and highlight.

In worksheet 3, we were required to highlight the employees whose names begin with the letter ‘E’ (using Yellow ) and lastly format the Salary Column to show the highest and lowest salaries highlighted with green and red backgrounds respectively.

###### **Table showing the names of employee splitted from one column to two**
To split the names of employees, i created a new column on the right side of the employee names to allow the splitted name fill it up. I proceeded further to use the Data section of the ribbon and selected text to column,  ticked the space option and perform the task. I searched for duplicates (no duplicates found)using the 'remove duplicate' function, i renamed the columns appropriately. The two tables below show the renamed column heads and the duplicate search.
